In order to obtain IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, 10 Courses are needed to be completed. Each one of them contain a peer-graded assignments at the end to finish. The last course to have a certificate is 'Applied Data Science Capstone' course, in which you need to analyze SpaceX's data to analyze whether SpaceX Falcon 9's first stage will land or not. To handle the problem, you are provided to accomplish 9 assignments related to each other. Those assignments are: 

1_spacex_data_collection_api.ipynb

You are asked to collect the data requesting SpaceX's api and to create a dataframe.

2_webscraping_spacex_launches_from_wikipedia.ipynb

You need to fetch the launch data from wikipedia's webpage.

3_spacex_data_wrangling.ipynb

It includes dealing with null data, turning categorical variables into dummy variables etc.

4_eda_data_visualization.ipynb

In this assignment, you make an explotary data analysis using visualization libraries.

5_eda_using_sql.ipynb

This assignment tests SQL skills to make an explotary data analysis.

6_launch_site_location_visualization_with_folium.ipynb

The main idea behind this assingment is to visualize some features of your dataset on the map, thus to extract if any geography-related factor exists. 

7_spacex_data_intereactive_dashboard_app.py

You have to build an interactive dashboard that user can see different aspects of the data by filtering or choosing some features.

8_spacex_machine_learning_prediction.ipynb

It is time to build a machine learning pipeline and get the predictions. Four different classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors) are applied, and their results are compared.

9_SpaceX_first_stage_landing_report.pptx

This is the presentation file to report your findings.
